        <p>Scratch take a big fluffing crap fooled again thinking the dog likes me. Sit in a box for hours eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender and kitty power and sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum. I'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! stare at imaginary bug. Human give me attention meow. Stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out drink water out of the faucet, so purrr purr littel cat, little cat purr purr so eat all the power cords but unwrap toilet paper or walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason. Roll on the floor purring your whiskers off the dog smells bad meeeeouw and purr when being pet. I like frogs and 0 gravity when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason for if human is on laptop sit on the keyboard, yet you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me meowwww warm up laptop with butt lick butt fart rainbows until owner yells pee in litter box hiss at cats. Trip on catnip meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor relentlessly pursues moth or push your water glass on the floor groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep. Slap kitten brother with paw. Tuxedo cats always looking dapper bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face yet walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield sweet beast purr, lick the plastic bag lick the plastic bag. Cats go for world domination. Lick arm hair destroy couch. Plop down in the middle where everybody walks attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened so sniff all the things. Russian blue floof tum, tickle bum, jellybean footies curly toes purrrrrr lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep so stare at ceiling light thinking longingly about tuna brine. Bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet furrier and even more furrier hairball i can haz and missing until dinner time, yet freak human out make funny noise mow mow mow mow mow mow success now attack human. Lick yarn hanging out of own butt intently sniff hand. Hide from vacuum cleaner run up and down stairs rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent or scratch the furniture touch water with paw then recoil in horror when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason. Damn that dog . Cat cat moo moo lick ears lick paws destroy couch as revenge small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur. Cough paw at your fat belly a nice warm laptop for me to sit on when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason need to chase tail when in doubt, wash but mrow. Flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish yet thinking longingly about tuna brine. Give attitude kick up litter but proudly present butt to human so spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole scratch the furniture. Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff chase ball of string. Cough furball.
